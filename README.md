## Pipenv for Virtual Environment
### First install of Environment

- open `cmd`
- `cd /your/local/github/repofolder/`
- `pipenv install`
- Restart VS Code
- Choose the newly created "tierli_ahluege" Virtual Environment python Interpreter

### Environment already installed (Update dependecies)
- open `cmd`
- `cd /your/local/github/repofolder/`
- `pipenv sync`
